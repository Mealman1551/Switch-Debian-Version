# Switch-Debian-Version

This simple script let you switch between Sid, Testing and Stable.

## How does it work?

This script updates the /etc/apt/sources.list to the right version you choose.

## What to do when it's installed?

You can use my other script for debloating your upgraded Debian: [Gnome-Corer](https://github.com/Mealman1551/Gnome-Corer)

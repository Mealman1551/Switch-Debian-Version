# Switch-Debian-Version

> [!Note]
> Im still testing this on Debian 13 Trixie

This simple script let you switch between Sid, Testing and Stable.

The script is named "s_deb_v.sh"
which means "Switch_Debian_version.shell"

## How does it work?

This script updates the /etc/apt/sources.list to the right version you choose.

## What to do when it's installed?

You can use my other script for debloating your upgraded Debian: [Gnome-Corer](https://github.com/Mealman1551/Gnome-Corer)
